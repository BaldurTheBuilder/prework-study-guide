## Description

As part of the introduction to coding for the UO coding bootcamp, a 15-20 hour prework assignment was created for students to go through. This prework acts as an introduction to HTML, Javascript, CSS, github, using the command line, and coding in general. The prework is intended to give a brief overview of the purpose and syntax of each system, and introduce concepts such as variables, loops, operations, and functions. This program is the result of that prework.

My motivation to complete this prework is mostly to gain experience with the real-world coding practices. I have previously taken several computer science classes which had me coding in C++, C, and Octave, so I have experience working with programming languages. However, prior to completing this prework I had no experience with github or the website building process. This real-world experience is my primary motivation for completing this program.

This program functions as the scaffolding through which someone may write notes for their programming classes. It should be noted that it lacks in user-friendliness, as you have to program every formatting change. For this reason, the notes in the file are quite sparse--I use OneNote in Microsoft Office for my actual notes and am using this program as a way to practice the actual skills involved in constructing it.
